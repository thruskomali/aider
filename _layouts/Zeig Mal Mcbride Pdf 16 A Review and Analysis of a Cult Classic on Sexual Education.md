However, due to the harsh weather conditions in India, most of the early paintings have not survived.[1] The only exceptions are the rock paintings that were carved or painted on natural rock surfaces, such as the ones found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters. These shelters are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and contain some of the oldest and finest examples of Stone Age art in India. Some of these rock paintings are estimated to be around 10,000 years old and depict animals, humans, and geometric patterns.
