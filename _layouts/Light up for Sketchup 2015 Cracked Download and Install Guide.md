## How to Install and Activate LightUp for SketchUp 2015 Ed
  
To use LightUp for SketchUp 2015 Ed, you need to have SketchUp 2015 or SketchUp 2016 installed on your computer. You can download the free trial of LightUp from [https://light-up.co.uk/](https://light-up.co.uk/) and follow the instructions to install it. Once installed, you will see a new toolbar in SketchUp with the LightUp icon.
  
To activate LightUp, you need to enter your license key that you received when you purchased the plugin. You can do this by clicking on the LightUp icon and selecting "Enter License Key". You will then be able to use LightUp for 30 days before you need to renew your license.
  
## How to Add and Adjust Different Types of Lights in Your Model
  
LightUp comes with five types of lights that you can add to your model: Sphere, Spot, Linear, Rectangular, and Disk. You can find them under the Enscape Objects button on the LightUp toolbar. To add a light, simply click on the type of light you want and then click on the location where you want to place it in your model. You can then adjust the properties of the light, such as color, intensity, radius, angle, etc., by clicking on the light and using the sliders in the Light Properties window.
  
It is important that you do not place the light source directly on the surface of your geometry, as this could result in unrealistic or unwanted effects. You should also avoid overlapping lights or placing them too close together, as this could cause overexposure or noise in your render.
  
## How to Use Viewpoint Lighting and Ambient Occlusion to Enhance Realism
  
One of the features that makes LightUp stand out from other renderers is its ability to use viewpoint lighting and ambient occlusion. Viewpoint lighting is a technique that automatically adjusts the brightness of your scene based on the direction of your camera. This means that you can create different moods and atmospheres by simply moving your camera around your model. To enable viewpoint lighting, click on the Viewpoint Lighting button on the LightUp toolbar and select a preset from the drop-down menu.
  
Ambient occlusion is a technique that simulates the subtle shadows that occur in corners and crevices of your model. This adds depth and realism to your render by making it look more natural and less flat. To enable ambient occlusion, click on the Ambient Occlusion button on the LightUp toolbar and adjust the slider to set the amount of occlusion you want.
