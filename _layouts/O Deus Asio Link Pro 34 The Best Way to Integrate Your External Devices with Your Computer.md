One of the most amazing features of the O Deus Asio Link Pro 34 is its ability to work with ASIO drivers. ASIO stands for Audio Stream Input/Output, and it is a standard protocol that allows audio applications to communicate directly with the audio hardware, bypassing the operating system's audio mixer. This results in lower latency, higher performance, and better sound quality. However, not all applications support ASIO drivers, and not all audio interfaces are compatible with ASIO drivers. That's where the O Deus Asio Link Pro 34 comes in.
