In this book, de Certeau analyzes how people use and transform the spaces, objects, and rules imposed by dominant institutions and systems of power. He argues that people are not passive consumers of culture, but active producers of meaning and creativity. He introduces the concepts of *strategies* and *tactics* to describe the different ways of operating in the world. Strategies are the rational and planned actions of those who have power and control over a space or a field of activity. Tactics are the improvised and opportunistic maneuvers of those who have no power or control, but who use the cracks and gaps in the dominant order to create their own spaces and practices.
 
De Certeau illustrates his ideas with examples from various domains of everyday life, such as walking in the city, reading, cooking, speaking, writing, and believing. He shows how people resist, subvert, or appropriate the norms and codes that shape their lives, and how they invent their own ways of being and doing. He also reflects on the role of the researcher and the writer in relation to their subjects and audiences, and on the ethical and political implications of studying everyday life.

One of the most influential chapters of *L'Invention du quotidien* is "Walking in the City", where de Certeau examines the practice of walking as a form of resistance and creativity in urban space. He contrasts the view from above, which represents the city as a rational and ordered system, with the view from below, which reveals the city as a chaotic and heterogeneous space. He argues that walkers are not mere followers of prescribed paths, but makers of their own trajectories and meanings. He compares walking to a speech act, a way of writing the city with one's feet. He also introduces the notion of *la perruque* (the wig), a term he borrowed from workers who use their employer's time and resources for their own purposes.
 
Another important chapter is "Reading as Poaching", where de Certeau analyzes the practice of reading as a form of appropriation and interpretation of texts. He challenges the idea that readers are passive recipients of the author's message, and argues that they are active agents who construct their own meanings and pleasures from the texts they encounter. He compares reading to a form of poaching, a way of stealing from the cultural field and making it one's own. He also discusses the role of memory, imagination, and fantasy in reading, and how they enable readers to escape from the constraints of reality.
 
A third significant chapter is "Believing and Making People Believe", where de Certeau explores the practice of believing as a form of social and cultural production. He examines how people create and maintain their beliefs in various contexts, such as religion, science, politics, and everyday life. He argues that believing is not a matter of accepting or rejecting a fixed set of doctrines or dogmas, but a matter of inventing and performing one's own ways of relating to the world and others. He also considers how people make others believe, through persuasion, manipulation, or seduction.
