## Step 2: Burn the ISO file to a CD or DVD
 
Once you have downloaded the ISO file, you need to burn it to a blank CD or DVD using a software that can handle ISO files. You can use any software that you prefer, such as ImgBurn, Nero, or CDBurnerXP. The process is usually simple and straightforward. Just insert a blank CD or DVD into your optical drive, launch the software, select the ISO file as the source, and start the burning process. You will need two CDs or DVDs for this operating system, as it comes in two parts[^2^]. Label them accordingly and keep them safe.

Now that you have the installation discs ready, you can proceed to install Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 SP2 (Korean) on your computer.

The installation process will guide you through several steps, such as accepting the license agreement, choosing a partition to install Windows on, formatting the partition, copying files, and setting up your preferences. You will also need to enter a product key during the installation. You can find some product keys online[^3^], but we recommend that you use a genuine one that you own or purchase from Microsoft. After entering the product key, you will need to insert the second disc when prompted. The installation process will continue until it is finished.
 
When the installation is complete, you will need to restart your computer and remove the disc from your optical drive.
