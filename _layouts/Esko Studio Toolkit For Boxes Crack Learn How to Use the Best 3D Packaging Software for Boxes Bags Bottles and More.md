You can also preview your box shape in 3D by clicking on the Preview button. When you are happy with your settings, click on OK. A new layer will be created in Illustrator with your box shape in 2D.
 
## Step 4: Apply your artwork to the box shape
 
Now you can apply your artwork to the box shape using Illustrator's tools and features. You can use any images, text, colors or effects that you want. For this example, we will use a simple logo and some text.
 
To apply your artwork to the box shape, you need to lock the layer that contains the box shape, and create a new layer above it for your artwork. Then, you can use the Selection tool (V) to select the parts of the box shape that you want to fill with your artwork, and copy them (Ctrl+C) and paste them in front (Ctrl+F) on the new layer. You can then use the Direct Selection tool (A) to adjust the anchor points and handles of the copied shapes to fit your artwork.
 
For example, to apply our logo to the front panel of the box, we select the front panel shape on the box layer, copy it and paste it in front on the artwork layer. Then, we adjust the anchor points and handles of the copied shape to match the size and position of our logo. We then fill the copied shape with our logo image using File > Place.
 
We repeat this process for each part of the box that we want to fill with our artwork. We also add some text using the Type tool (T) and some colors using the
